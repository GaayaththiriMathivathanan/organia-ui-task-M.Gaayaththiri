# Service Provider Management Application

The **Service Provider Management Application** is a modern web-based system built with Next.js 14 (App Router) and TypeScript to efficiently manage service provider information. It features dynamic multi-section forms with real-time state management, interactive maps powered by React Leaflet for accurate location selection, and a fully responsive professional UI designed using Tailwind CSS. The application supports sidebar navigation, seamless tab switching (T01, T02, etc.), structured data entry for Main and Sub Details, and synchronized latitude/longitude updates through map interaction. Developed using Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Leaflet, Leaflet, and Lucide React, the system ensures scalability, usability, and a clean design. It can be easily customized through `tailwind.config.ts` for theme colors and `MapComponent.tsx` for map settings, and supports production builds using standard Next.js build commands.
