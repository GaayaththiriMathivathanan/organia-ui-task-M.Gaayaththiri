Modern Next.js 14 application for managing service provider data with dynamic forms, interactive map integration, and a responsive Tailwind CSS UI.
# Service Provider Management Application

The **Service Provider Management Application** is a modern web-based system developed using Next.js 14 (App Router) and TypeScript to efficiently manage service provider information. The application features dynamic multi-section forms, tab-based navigation (T01, T02, etc.), and interactive map integration using React Leaflet for accurate location selection with automatic latitude and longitude synchronization. The user interface is designed with Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive and professional layout. The project is built using Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Leaflet, Leaflet, and Lucide React. To set up the project, clone the repository, navigate to the project folder, run `npm install`, and start the development server using `npm run dev`, then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. The README includes screenshots of the final UI for reference. Current limitations include the absence of backend database integration, authentication features, and permanent data storage, as the system currently operates on a frontend-based implementation.
